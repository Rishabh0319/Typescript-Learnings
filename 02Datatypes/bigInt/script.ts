// Q: What is BigInt type ?

// Ans: it is a built in type that allows you to work with numbers that are larger then the range supported by the regular number type

// * in javascript we can't read the whole numbers beyond 2 raise to power 53 

// * bigInt literals are written by appending the n suffix to an integer litteral.
